                'Cause we lost everything<br>
                We had to pay the price<br>
                <br>
                I saw in you what life was missing<br>
                You lit a flame that consumed my hate<br>
                I'm not one for reminiscing but<br>
                I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace<br>
                <br>
                'Cause we lost everything<br>
                We had to pay the price<br>
                <br>
                There's a canvas with two faces<br>
                Of fallen angels who loved and lost<br>
                It was a passion for the ages<br>
                But in the end guess we paid the cost<br>
                <br>
                A thing of beauty - I know<br>
                Will never fade away<br>
                What you did to me - I know<br>
                Said what you had to say<br>
                But a thing of beauty<br>
                <br>
                Will nеver fade away<br>
                Will nevеr fade away<br>
                <br>
                I see your eyes, I know you see me<br>
                You're like a ghost, you're everywhere<br>
                I'm your demon, never leaving<br>
                A metal soul of rage and fear<br>
                <br>
                That one thing that changed it all<br>
                That one sin that caused the fall<br>
                <br>
                A thing of beauty - I know<br>
                Will never fade away<br>
                What you did to me - I know<br>
                Said what you had to say<br>
                But a thing of beauty - I know<br>
                Will never fade away<br>
                And I'll do my duty - I know<br>
                Somehow I'll find a way<br>
                But a thing of beauty<br>
                Will never fade away<br>
                And I'll do my duty<br>
                <br>
                We'll never fade away<br>
                We'll never fade away<br>
                We'll never fade away<br>
                We'll never fade away<br>
