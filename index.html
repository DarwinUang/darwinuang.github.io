            lyrics:

            'Cause we lost everything
            We had to pay the price

            I saw in you what life was missing
            You lit a flame that consumed my hate
            I'm not one for reminiscing but
            I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace

            'Cause we lost everything
            We had to pay the price

            There's a canvas with two faces
            Of fallen angels who loved and lost
            It was a passion for the ages
            But in the end guess we paid the cost

            A thing of beauty - I know
            Will never fade away
            What you did to me - I know
            Said what you had to say
            But a thing of beauty

            Will nеver fade away
            Will nevеr fade away

            I see your eyes, I know you see me
            You're like a ghost, you're everywhere
            I'm your demon, never leaving
            A metal soul of rage and fear

            That one thing that changed it all
            That one sin that caused the fall

            A thing of beauty - I know
            Will never fade away
            What you did to me - I know
            Said what you had to say
            But a thing of beauty - I know
            Will never fade away
            And I'll do my duty - I know
            Somehow I'll find a way
            But a thing of beauty
            Will never fade away
            And I'll do my duty

            We'll never fade away
            We'll never fade away
            We'll never fade away
            We'll never fade away
        </p>
